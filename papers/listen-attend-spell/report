We want to get the experiment results 

So we build it from scratch (the rnn)

First we need to learn about the input sequence and filter bank spectra features 
autovc -> this paper -> filter bank spectra


Amplitude	: Instantaneous loudness	Low-level (not enough to understand speech)
Energy	: Intensity over time (e.g., syllable boundaries)	Some info (helps with silence vs speech)
Frequency : Pitch, formants, harmonics	⭐ Core info for phonemes, words, emotion


->so frequency is the key to understand what the spaeker spoke


we want to model P(y|x) as contidiontal probabilty of y given x,out puts produced till that token .(eq 1 in section 3 of Listen,Attend and spell.pdf)


Now reading the LSTM and BLSTM

using the time machine dataset in d2l for learning lstm
